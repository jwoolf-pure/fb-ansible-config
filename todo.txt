install the following modules:
    ansible-vault
    netaddr
    paramiko  -- paramiko may already be installed but check to be sure.
    pytz


edit the ansible.cfg file add the following line
library = ./local_modules  -- this just changed to use the host_variables directory for sites/flashblades
    local_modules also changed again.  I modified at least two of the modules.

*** copy contents of local_modules into your project directory.  Change was made to add ability to only use either site_env OR site_blade and no longer requires both variables.

Also added the new module to handle the api tokens.

copy in the following roles:
    *** copy-template - This role changed again
    pure_cert
    pure_network
    pure_ir_passwd
    pure_ir_execline
    pure_policy
    *** pure_syslog - changed to add port setting.
    *** pure_api_token


The infra.yml file will have changed.
*** Copy in token_update.yml

Adopt the changes in the roles/copy-template/templates/vars_file_template.yml for the policy role.
