install the following modules:
    purity-fb
    py-pure-client
    ansible-vault
    netaddr
    paramiko  -- paramiko may already be installed but check to be sure.
    pytz


Copy in the project.

In the group_vars directory,  create a directory with the same name as each of your site names.

You can use either group_vars/npc/npc_vars.yml or group_vars/wpc/wpc_vars.yml file as a template for
creating variables files for your sites.  Create the variables files.

You'll have to do a one time edit on the roles/generate_variables role.  In the roles/generate_variables/main.yml file there are the following lines:

 - include_vars: ./group_vars/npc/npc_vars.yml
   when: site == 'npc'

You'll need to add an entry for each site that points to the variable files you just created in the previous steps.


In the ./host_variables directory,  you'll also need to create a directory for each site name.  In each directory you'll need to create a file for each flashblade with the name of the flashblade being the name of the file.  Here is an example file:

---

 name: npc-pure-0012-p
 fb_url: 172.29.10.190
 api_token: T-b749601e-da1e-4c12-860f-c5f259a55838
 cert_file: /Users/jwoolf/PycharmProjects/Apple-Ansible/certs/cert.pem
 cert_key_file: /Users/jwoolf/PycharmProjects/Apple-Ansible/certs/key.pem
 data_network:
   prefix: 10.150.0.0/16
   gateway: 10.150.1.1
   mtu: 9000
   vlan: 2200
   interfaces:
     -
       address: 10.150.10.10



in the ansible.cfg file, you may want to point the setting for the vault password outside of the project directory.

you can use "ansible-vault encrypt host_variables/<site>/flashblade_name" to encrypt it.
